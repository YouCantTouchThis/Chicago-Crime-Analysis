# Chicago-Crime-Analysis
A very basic analysis of crime in Chicago. 

Chicago was split into a grid. The number of crimes within each grid along with the distance of the police station from the center of the grid was calculated. The correlation between the distance and crime density was calculated. 
- In hindsight a much better method of calculating the correlation between crimes and police station distance could have been employed

Things to improve:
- analyse using police station density in an area vs crime in the area.
- analysing using chicago county/subsections for more meaningful conclusions
- include socioeconomic variable
    - using Census Block Group data could be helpful
